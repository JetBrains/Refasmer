Changelog
=========
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- [#38: Internal types in public API break `omit-non-api-members=true`](https://github.com/JetBrains/Refasmer/issues/38).
- Fix regression since v2.0.0: public compiler-generated types are no longer ommitted from the refasmed assemblies.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-11-20
### Changed
- **(Breaking change!)** A new mandatory parameter `--omit-non-api-types` (pass either `true` or `false`).

  This parameter determines when to preserve or omit private nested types in value types. We have made it mandatory since the previous changes in the value type behavior might've been caused confusion in cases when the user wanted to remove _all_ the private API from an assembly.

  `--omit-non-api-types false` closely corresponds to the behavior from 1.0.33; `--omit-non-api-types true` corresponds to the behavior from 1.0.32.

  Refasmer now does its best to preserve some of the value type semantics even with `--omit-non-api-types true`: it will emit synthetic private field in a value type even if it has removed all the fields before. Note that this change might not preserve the type blittability and still affect the compilation. 

## [1.0.33] - 2023-05-11
### Fixed
- [#18](https://github.com/JetBrains/Refasmer/issues/18): always import all members of the value types, since they may affect the compilation behavior.
- [#20: Bad signature is produced for function pointers](https://github.com/JetBrains/Refasmer/issues/20).
